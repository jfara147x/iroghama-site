        <div class="col-lg-6"> <p> <b> 1. Corporate Commercial Contracts </b> </p>
		  <p> Regardless of where your business sits on the maturity curve (from innovative start-ups looking to disrupt the market, through to recognised global conglomerates with an established industry presence), your commercial arrangements are fundamental to the success of your business. </p>

			<p>When contracting these arrangements you will need to: </p>
			<li>	Rapidly assess the commercial and legal risks and issues involved. </li>
				<li>	Focus on those risks and issues which represent the true ‘value drivers’ in your deal</li>
				<li>	Clearly document the arrangement in a way which ensures your interests and commercial concerns are protected, while appropriately incentivising your counterparty to perform.</li>

<p>Our market leading commercial contracts and strategic sourcing practices have extensive experience across all forms of contracts and commercial agreements. We prioritise understanding how your commercial arrangement fits into your wider business strategy and the key risks and opportunities that this presents. Our attention to your specific needs means we provide you with focused legal and strategic advice that goes to the value of your deal.</p>

<p>Our commercial solutions are tailored to the circumstances of your particular transaction and your organisation. We will embark on your new projects with no preconceptions as to the ‘right way’ to implement them, but rather with a pragmatic, flexible approach, which draws on our broad and varied contracting experience.</p>
			
</div>
      <div class="col-lg-6"><p> <b> 2. Crisis Management </b> </p>
		
			<p> Our crisis management lawyers help you prevent and prepare for, respond to, and recover from crises. In today’s global media environment, crises require a swift and sure-footed response, taking account of the subject matter and the stakeholders involved. </p>

			<p>A crisis can put in jeopardy your reputation, financial stability, and key relationships around the world. It can also divert senior management time from the strategic objective of your business. </p>

			<p>How to manage a crisis once it has occurred is of acute concern to all large businesses, their boards and their management teams. Ideally, however, a potential crisis would have been prevented, avoided or mitigated before it occurred or grew into a more existential event. Our cross-border, cross management team helps you: </p>
			<li>	Prepare: plan for the unexpected.</li>
     		<li>	Respond: mobilise and take control.</li>
			<li>	Recover: re-orientate to a new normal.</li>
